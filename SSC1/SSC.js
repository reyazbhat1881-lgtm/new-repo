Automation threatens 69 per cent of the jobs in India, while 77 per cent in China, according to a World Bank research which has said that technology could fundamentally disrupt the pattern of traditional economic path in developing countries. As we continue to encourage more investment in infrastructure to promote growth, we also have to think about the kinds of infrastructure that countries will need in the economy of the future. We all know that technology has and will continue to fundamentally reshape the world. World Bank president Jim Kim said, But the traditional economic path from increasing productivity of agriculture to light manufacturing and then to full-scale industrialization may not be possible for all developing countries. Mr. Kim said in response to a question at the Brookings Institute during a discussion on extreme poverty on Tuesday. In large parts of Africa, it is likely that technology could fundamentally disrupt this pattern. Research based on World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened in India by automation is 69 per cent, in China it is 77 per cent and in Ethiopia, the percentage of jobs threatened by automation is 85 per cent, he said, Now, if this is true, and if these countries are going to lose these many jobs, we then have to understand what paths to economic growth will be available for these countries and then adapt our approach to infrastructure accordingly. Mr. Kim said. Automation is not just a threat for India, it is so all over the world. Unless the educated youth are trained in utilizing the land and animal residues for creating more roads and other infrastructure, the future of employment looks bleak in developing countries."

                text: "The next fortnight will see world leaders, industrialists, activists, and indigenous peoples converge at the 28th edition of the Conference of the Parties. This annual affair is an attempt to inch ahead on getting at least 190 countries, all members of the United Nations climate framework, to act on weaning their economies off fossil fuels. The current goal is to make good on a collective commitment made by countries in Paris, in 2015, to strive to hold global temperatures to no higher than 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century and definitely below 2 degrees Celsius. In the nearly three decades of COP meetings, the major economies have agreed on three broad principles. Countries that rapidly industrialised in the 20th century have disproportionately emitted more carbon than their fair share given the population sustained. Economic growth premised on fossil fuel consumption, while cheaper per unit than renewable energy, spells disaster. And developing countries and those with minimal industrial infrastructure today must be compensated for adopting costlier, but cleaner, non-fossil fuel sources for growing their economies. There is also a consensus that the countries already weathering climate disasters must be compensated and also paid to bolster their infrastructure. However, getting all countries to actually act on these principles is onerous given the mutual suspicion, the spirit of de-globalisation, and the fear of political reprisal that heads of governments face within their constituencies. The challenge remains in translating commitments into concrete action that can meaningfully address the climate crisis."

                text: "The Staff Selection Commission conducts various examinations for recruitment to different posts in Ministries, Departments and Organizations of the Government of India. The Commission was set up in 1975 and since then it has been serving the nation by selecting suitable candidates for various Group B and Group C posts in Government offices spread across the country. The selection process generally consists of a Computer Based Examination followed by a Descriptive Paper and a Skill Test or Typing Test depending on the post applied for. The typing test is conducted to assess the typing speed and accuracy of candidates. For Lower Division Clerk and Junior Secretariat Assistant posts, candidates are required to type at a speed of 35 words per minute in English or 30 words per minute in Hindi. The test duration is usually 10 minutes for CHSL and 15 minutes for CGL examinations. Candidates must practice regularly to improve their typing speed while maintaining high accuracy. The typing test is of qualifying nature and though it does not carry marks, failing to meet the required speed will result in disqualification. Regular practice with sample passages is essential for success. Candidates should familiarize themselves with the keyboard layout and practice touch typing to avoid looking at the keyboard. Time management during the test is crucial as candidates need to complete typing the given passage within the stipulated time while ensuring minimum errors. The Commission provides a practice session before the actual test begins."

The country has a rich cultural heritage spanning thousands of years. Indian civilization is one of the oldest in the world and has made significant contributions to mathematics, science, philosophy, and arts. The decimal system, the concept of zero, yoga, and Ayurveda are some of India's gifts to the world. The Indian economy has shown remarkable growth in recent decades and is now one of the fastest-growing major economies globally. The service sector, particularly information technology, has been a major driver of this growth. However, agriculture still employs a large portion of the population and remains vital to the economy. India faces several challenges including poverty, inequality, and environmental degradation. The government has launched various programs to address these issues including initiatives for financial inclusion, skill development, and sustainable development. Education and healthcare are priority areas with increased budgetary allocations. The country has made significant progress in space research, nuclear technology, and pharmaceutical manufacturing. Indian scientists and engineers have made notable contributions to global technological advancement. The youth of India represent a significant demographic advantage and with proper education and training, they can drive the nation towards greater prosperity. Digital India initiative aims to transform the country into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy."

Climate change, caused primarily by greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, is leading to rising global temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events. The consequences of environmental degradation are far-reaching and affect every aspect of life on Earth. Deforestation, pollution, and loss of biodiversity threaten the delicate balance of ecosystems. It is imperative that immediate action be taken to address these issues before irreversible damage occurs. Governments around the world have committed to reducing carbon emissions and transitioning to renewable sources of energy. Solar, wind, and hydroelectric power are being promoted as alternatives to fossil fuels. Energy efficiency measures are being implemented in industries, buildings, and transportation. Waste management and recycling programs are being strengthened to reduce the burden on landfills. Afforestation and reforestation projects are being undertaken to increase green cover. Protection of wildlife and natural habitats is being prioritized through the establishment of protected areas and wildlife corridors. Sustainable agricultural practices are being encouraged to reduce the environmental impact of farming. Water conservation and management are critical given the increasing scarcity of freshwater resources. Individual actions also play a significant role in environmental conservation. Simple steps like reducing plastic use, conserving energy and water, using public transport, and supporting eco-friendly products can make a difference. Environmental education and awareness are essential to create a society that values and protects nature."
